            My broad knowledge base and critical thinking skills have allowed me to be a benefit to every team I have been a part of.  To my peers, I have been known to offer insightful analysis to challenges they may face.  One of my best skills is the ability to listen to the needs of my customers. It may feel obvious as well that you are obligated to actually pay attention to your customers, so that you know what their needs may be. I am a believer in detailed communication and the necessity for team collaboration.  Which is no replacement for hard work and determination.  Two more of my notable skills.  In my past roles as a manager or director I have gained  a broad analysis of effective management and team building.  Through solid research and exploration I persistently quest for new techniques or methods to enhance my abilities.  I find discovery an essential role in business development and enhances preparedness.   This is why I am a lifelong learner.

              <p>In this app, the focus was on ensuring people with disabilities can access the Horiseon website using assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and a special keyboard.

                In hopes of making my clients approving of my services, I also improved the codebase and  reworked their previous file structure to make it more efficient,

              <p>Working with the Run Buddy team was an exciting; making the project fun to work on.  I was albe to stretch my knowledge of HTML and CSS.
                The Run Buddy had very specific criteria for this project.  We added a form to the Reach Out section, so that users can submit questions directly to the sales staff.  
                I also made updates for Hero Section to include inspirational message to connect with the community.

                This project is version 2.0 for this company and  includes some subtle visual changes like rounded corners on the forms. 
                A few other changes reveal themselves as the user interacts with the page.   The customer seemd please with the work and this has been the main focus all along.
